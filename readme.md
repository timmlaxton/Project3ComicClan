# Group Java Project
#### Database Site for Comics

Group project for CodeClan, this project was built over a period of 6 days with @laurasheach and @shaunhk.

A full stack app using a JavaScript/JSX/React frontend and RESTful API routes to a Java/Spring/Hibernate/PostgreSQL backend. The user profiles have full CRUD functionality.

The information contained in the database for the comics for the app was built ourselves.
